# Hello!


In Spring 2022 I got my Masters Degree in Quantitative Methods in Social Science from CUNY Graduate Center, in May of 2019 I got my Bachelors Degree In International Relations from Pennslyvania State University. I am currently a Back End Engineer focusing primarily on Computer vision models with reagrds to video, as well as gathering and scraping data from said videos. I am also a Technical Coach for a data analytics certificate program. 


## ðŸ”­ Current Projects 

### I am currently working on two major projects at the moment


[Valorant Project](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Valorant): Machine Learning Image Classification on Valorant Agents and Maps.  

[Stock Modeling Project](Stock_Modeling_Program): Create a machine learning model which can acurately predict outcomes from historical stock predictions. 

## :heavy_check_mark: Finished Projects 

### I have finished multiple projects most of which are assignments that I've done during classes or in a way to finish my degree


[Capstone Project](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Terrorism-Capstone-Models): Identify statistically signifcant variables which influence terrorism or how terrorism is effect by said variables. Utilizing these vairables identify the accuracy of creating a model from those variables

[Machine Learning Assignments](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Machine-Learning): Creation of Logistic Regression and Linear Regression Machine Learning models from scratch, as well as utlizing gradiant decent to optimize outcomes. And use Sklearn to run a MLP on the wine quality data set. 

[Terrorism in US Maps](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Data_Visualization_Project): Terrorism is a problem which has no solution or end in sight. Because of this understanding the historical and emprical patterns of terrorism specifically in the United States helps clear up miss communications in terrorism patterns and actions. 


## ðŸŒ± I'm Currently Learning: 
Currenting learning more about API as well as back end development.
