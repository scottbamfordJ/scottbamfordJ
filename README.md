# Hello!


In Spring 2022 I got my Masters Degree in Quantitative Methods in Social Science from CUNY Graduate Center, in May of 2019 I got my Bachelors Degree In International Relations from Pennslyvania State University. I have worked with Up In the Chair as a Intern focusing on creation of systems which would gather public sentiment on companys direction. I during my masters degree I worked as a research assitant utilizing the google suite to codify political tweets based upon a criteria, and R and ArcGIS to create visualizations and tablize ArcGIS tables. Currently I am working as an Engineering Intern at Foursquare, and was previously a Data Product Intern at Foursquare. 


## ðŸ”­ Current Projects 

### I am currently working on two major projects at the moment


[Valorant Project](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Valorant): Machine Learning Image Classification on Valorant Agents and Maps.  

[Stock Modeling Project](Stock_Modeling_Program): Create a machine learning model which can acurately predict outcomes from historical stock predictions. 

## Finished Projects 

### I have finished multiple projects most of which are assignments that I've done during classes or in a way to finish my degree


[Capstone Project](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Terrorism-Capstone-Models): Identify statistically signifcant variables which influence terrorism or how terrorism is effect by said variables. Utilizing these vairables identify the accuracy of creating a model from those variables

[Machine Learning Assignments](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Machine-Learning): Creation of Logistic Regression and Linear Regression Machine Learning models from scratch, as well as utlizing gradiant decent to optimize outcomes. And use Sklearn to run a MLP on the wine quality data set. 

[Terrorism in US Maps](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Data_Visualization_Project): Terrorism is a problem which has no solution or end in sight. Because of this understanding the historical and emprical patterns of terrorism specifically in the United States helps clear up miss communications in terrorism patterns and actions. 


## ðŸŒ± I'm Currently Learning: 
I am learning more about AWS specifically S3 buckets as well as using Snowflake. I have plently of experience in SQL but re learning the limitaitons of Presto.
