# Hello!

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-bamford/):

In Spring 2022 I got my Masters Degree in Quantitative Methods in Social Science from CUNY Graduate Center, in May of 2019 I got my Bachelors Degree In International Relations from Pennslyvania State University. I am a self proclaimed Data Junky and I am always interested finding and potentially getting data in order to answer questions that I've had about the topic. 


## ðŸ”­ Current Projects 

### I am currently working on two major projects at the moment


[Valorant Project](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Valorant): Machine Learning Image Classification on Valorant Agents and Maps.  

[Stock Modeling Project](Stock_Modeling_Program): Create a machine learning model which can acurately predict outcomes from historical stock predictions. 

[Balatro Computer Vision](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Project-To-Do/tree/main/Balatro%20Computer%20Vision): Computer Vision to Optimize Card Choice based upon hit Rogue Like Balatro

[Balatro Card Creation](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Project-To-Do/tree/main/Balatro%20Computer%20VisionFinished_Card): Creating Sythetic Dataset (Cards) to train the Above Machine Learning Project


## :heavy_check_mark: Finished Projects 

### I have finished multiple projects most of which are assignments that I've done during classes or in a way to finish my degree

[Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Project-To-Do/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction): Utlizing Machine Learning Techniques to predict diabetes

[Capstone Project](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Terrorism-Capstone-Models): Identify statistically signifcant variables which influence terrorism or how terrorism is effect by said variables. Utilizing these vairables identify the accuracy of creating a model from those variables

[Machine Learning Assignments](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Machine-Learning): Creation of Logistic Regression and Linear Regression Machine Learning models from scratch, as well as utlizing gradiant decent to optimize outcomes. And use Sklearn to run a MLP on the wine quality data set. 

[Polynomial Regression Analysis](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Project-A-Week/tree/main/Cleaning%20and%20Analyzing%20IBM%20Watson%20Marketing%20Customer%20Value): Utlized and wrote out a report with (Basic A/B testing and Polynomial Regression) on Pokemon Dataset. 

[Terrorism in US Maps](https://github.com/scottbamfordJ/Data_Visualization_Project): Terrorism is a problem which has no solution or end in sight. Because of this understanding the historical and emprical patterns of terrorism specifically in the United States helps clear up miss communications in terrorism patterns and actions. 


## ðŸŒ± I'm Currently Learning: 
Currenting learning more about API as well as back end development.
